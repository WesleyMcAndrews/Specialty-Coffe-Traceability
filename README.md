# Specialty Coffee Production and Traceability Platform


![](specialty_coffee.jpg)

Specialty Coffee Production and Traceability Platform is a comprehensive tool for managing all phases of coffee production, from georeferenced field mapping with terrain slope and sun orientation data to tracking daily agrometeorological data. Our platform also offers features like sequential water balance calculations, coffee classification according to the SCAA protocol, and support for quality contests with mobile device compatibility.

## Why traceability matters to consummers?
Strong attractiveness and demand for sustainable products with guaranteed quality and origin.
No more advertising claims (gourmet, premium, coffeehouse-style, etc.)
Shows transparency to the consumer and tells an authentic story about a high-quality product.
Consumers are actively seeking authentic experiences. This includes not only the coffee's flavour but also its story. Coffee becomes an emotional experience.
Perception of peculiarity that translates into extra earnings.
Consumers indoctrinated into seasonality, vintage, origin, competitions. The world of coffee becomes intimate and personal.
